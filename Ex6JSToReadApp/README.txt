#JavaScript ToReadApp: A modified TodoApp exercise
An app will be created that creates from user's query (search) terms a query link of
review articles from top tier scientific publication groups, namely Nature, Cell and Frontiers.
The user can then review the query link to select articles they want to read later
by adding them to the ToReadApp as a 'todo' item.
Example:
query 'variant interaction combined effect'
query link from which 3 articles each will be retrieved and added to todo list
https://www.nature.com/search?q=variant%20interaction%20combined%20effect&article_type=reviews&order=relevance
https://www.cell.com/action/doSearch?text1=variant+interaction+combined+effect&field1=AllField&startPage=&ContentItemType=rev
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles?domain=all&query=variant%20interaction%20combined%20effect&type=review
