#JavaScript ToReadApp: A modified TodoApp exercise
An app will be created that creates from user's query (search) terms a query link of
review articles from top tier scientific publication groups, namely Nature, Cell and Frontiers.
Also, Pubmed review articles from above and all other journals with available Full-Text-Free
will be listed.
Popular science magazine Scientific American (Nature publications), Science Focus (BBC),
New Scientist, The Scientist and Science News.
The user can then review the query link to select articles they want to read later
by adding them to the ToReadApp as a 'todo' item.
Example:
query 'whole genome sequencing'
query link from which 3 articles each will be retrieved and added to todo list
